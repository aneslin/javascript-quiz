This is a five question quiz with simple questions about Javascript.  A timer with 60 seconds begins ticking down when a user starts the quiz.  When a user selects the correct answer, the quiz advances to the next question.  If the answer is incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted from the timer and the quiz advances to the next question.
